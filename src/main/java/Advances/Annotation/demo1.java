/**

 *  1) Annotation is a feature in JDK >= 5.0
 *
 *  2) Annotation is a special `sign` of the code, these sign
 *     can be compiled, overloaded, and read during runtime.
 *     Developers can "insert" extra information to the code
 *     without any code change via Annotation
 *
 *  3) Annotation can be used  as `modifier` (e.g. public, private, static...);
 *     can be used in package, class, constructor, method, variables, parameters...
 *     (these information are stored in name=value)
