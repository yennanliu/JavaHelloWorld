/**
 *  future cancel fixing (modified by gpt)
 *
 *  - boolean c = future.cancel(true);
 *
 *
 *  1. Check for Interruption in the Loop:
 * 	  - Within the infinite loop, I added a check if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted())
 * 	    to break the loop if the thread is interrupted.
 *
 * 	2.	Thread Interruption Handling:
 * 	  - When future.cancel(true) is called, it interrupts the thread running the task.
 * 	    The check within the loop ensures that the thread stops executing when it is interrupted.
 *
 * 	3.	Executor Shutdown:
 * 	  - The executor.shutdown() is still called in the finally block
 * 	    to ensure that the executor is properly shut down,
 * 	    but now the thread running the task will properly exit when interrupted.
 *
