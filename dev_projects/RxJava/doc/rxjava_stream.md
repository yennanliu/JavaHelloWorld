# RxJava Streams: Concept vs. Interface

In RxJava, "streams" refer to the concept of an asynchronous, observable sequence of data or events over time. This concept is realized through various reactive types such as `Observable`, `Flowable`, `Single`, `Maybe`, and `Completable`. Below is an explanation of these concepts, interfaces, and classes in RxJava.

## Concept of Streams in RxJava

- **Concept**: In RxJava, the idea of a "stream" refers to the flow of data or events over time. This data flow is managed using reactive types like `Observable`, `Flowable`, `Single`, `Maybe`, and `Completable`. The term "stream" is used to describe how data moves through these sequences and how you interact with it.

- **Interfaces and Classes**: While RxJava defines several interfaces and classes to represent these streams, there isn't a single interface called `Stream` in RxJava like there is in the Java Stream API. Instead, RxJava's reactive types (`Observable`, `Flowable`, etc.) each implement their own interfaces, which allow them to be treated as streams of data.

## Key Reactive Types in RxJava

### `Observable<T>`
Represents a stream that can emit multiple items or events over time, or none at all. It can also complete or emit an error.

### `Flowable<T>`
Similar to `Observable`, but with support for backpressure, making it suitable for streams where the rate of data production might overwhelm the consumer.

### `Single<T>`
Represents a stream that emits a single item or an error.

### `Maybe<T>`
Represents a stream that can emit either a single item, no item, or an error.

### `Completable`
Represents a stream that only handles completion or error events, without emitting any items.

## Summary

In RxJava, the concept of a "stream" refers to the flow of data through these reactive types. While there isn't a `Stream` interface, the reactive types themselves (e.g., `Observable`, `Flowable`) embody the idea of streams in RxJava. They provide the tools to work with asynchronous, event-driven data in a way that is similar in spirit to the Java Stream API but with added capabilities for handling time, concurrency, and asynchronous events.
